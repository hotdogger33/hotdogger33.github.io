        <h2>About us</h2>
        <p>	The Tactical World Observation Group, which has been recording data and simulating exercises since 2022, is a Non Profit Organization founded in 2024, with the intent of modeling economic, social, political, climate, and technological scenarios in a comparative world meant to mirror the events and common dilemmas faced in the real world. The TWOG has seen the simulations grow in complexity and scale almost continuously, expanding the focus and variables contributing to the events of the model; starting off as a purely political based model similar to that of Model UN conferences, the project would expand to include further issues regarding the financial growth and development of regions, long term social, religious, and technological developments, and how such changes impact both local and global interactions.
        </p>

        <h2>Timeline of the model</h2>
        <p>The TWOG exercise, which has gone through various iterations, features a timeline of comprehensive action running from the industrial revolution, primarily due to its important impact on both world political, economical, and national development, all the way to the modern era. Progression of this timeline was nearly wholly linear, focusing on the development of the model in the aftermath of an economic crisis, continuing on from the predetermined background information, advancing on as it saw the world split along further ideological lines, before emerging in a more fractured state as direct competition died out in favour of more universal progress. An alternative model was run, this time continuing from an earlier point revolving around a contemporary “industrial revolution”, so to speak, which focused on determining the earlier developments of nationalism, economic philosophies, and the effects of colonial and imperial ambitions as well as the base models considerations. All manner of religions, ethnicities, and existing ideologies and economic models had been predetermined before the start of the exercise, designed to represent both exact parallels and hybridized fusions of real world contemporaries. As the model progressed, the evolution, syncretization, and interaction of such ideas would result in both significant changes to such pre-existing concepts, and the births of new ones.
        </p>

        <h2>Model History</h2>
        <p>
        The model would start off as a much more amateurish project in 2022, without many of the later sophistications in development, leading to a flawed early model, before coming into its own as the TWOG developed. Initial considerations focused solely on a singular dual continental model, before later expanding to feature nine major land masses, with three in particular being more prominent. The development of such a continuing situation would see the model expand and transform to place a greater emphasis on trade, environmental issues, and the period of decolonization. Initially, each member of the exercise was prompted to represent a singular sovereign entity, with all members conferring together to determine developments and updates to the model itself. Over time, sovereign entities and various groups would be introduced which were not managed or controlled by a singular member, so as to represent disparate parties. Technological developments, in particular, were seen as instrumental to the stable development of the model, resultantly, so as to not stray from its intended purpose of mirroring and proposing alternative possibilities to real world scenarios, technological advancements and implementations were kept mostly in line with such developments in the real world.
